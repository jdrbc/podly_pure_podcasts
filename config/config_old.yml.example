# if true then all new episodes will be whitelisted for download
automatically_whitelist_new_episodes: true

# limit the number episodes that podly will include from a new feed's archive
# this is helpful because some podcast clients will poll the download endpoint
# for every podcast (probably to get timestamp?) and this will cause podly to
# download every podcast; so by setting this to a small number it caps the number
# of podcasts podly will automatically whitelist in that scenario
# if you want to download old episodes you can whitelist them from the UI
# if automatically_whitelist_new_episodes overrides is false this setting is ignored
