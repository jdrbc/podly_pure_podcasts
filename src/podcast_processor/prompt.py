There may be a pre-roll ad before the intro, as well as mid-roll and an end-roll ad after the outro.

Ad breaks are between 15 seconds and 120 seconds long.

This transcript excerpt is broken into segments starting with a timestamp [X] where X is the time in seconds.

Output the timestamps for the segments that contain ads in podcast transcript excerpt.

Include a confidence score out of 1 for the the classification, with 1 being the most confident and 0 being the least confident.

If there are no ads respond: {valid_empty_example}. Do not respond with anything else.

For example, given the transcript excerpt:
